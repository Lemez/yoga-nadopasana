<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<div class="tldr">
A former professional touring musician, composer and producer,  I now work full-time in between music, medicine and therapy. I discovered Nadopasana as part of Carnatic music training in South India, and after four years' intensive study, I use it as a framework to inform all my work. 
</div><br>

I moved in Tamil Nadu, South India, with my family in 2012. Having spent twenty years as a professional musician and songwriter, working as a trumpet player, singer, composer and producer in both art and commercial music, I had become increasingly disillusioned, and quit. In IndiaBecoming a father i 2012 had a radical impact on how I understood music, and I started to investigate how we can use music to improve our physical and psychological health. I now work with Nigel Osborne, the pioneering music therapist and community music leader, in the field of music and trauma, and am training in Orff Music Therapy with Ksenija Buric.

My discovery of Yoga Nadopasana was by chance: at the time, I had quit music professionally for several years, and was running a startup company in the field of language acquisition and literacy.

I was invited to India for one week. In that week living at Adishakti Theatre, I came across Carnatic music in the form of the vocalist M D Ramanathan. I did not know it at the time, but he was a singer who epitomised bhava, the synthesis of artistic intention and spiritual focus. I have written quite a few pieces about the effect of discovering Carnatic music 

After months of enquiries, I was finally accepted by a wonderfully generous teacher in Pondicherry, Shobha Raghavan (Aurobindo Ashram), whose diligent teaching and endless patience with my inane questions instilled in me the initial disciple and love for the basic practice that forms the base of Nadopasana.

 After one year studying Carnatic vocal music in Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu, with 
Shobha Raghavan (Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry), she was sadly involved in a serious car accident. 

I was introduced to Yoga Nadopasana through Bruno Leduc-Corbet, a disciple of the sublime veena artist [M. Nageswara Rao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzfzz_c27pk&list=RDQzfzz_c27pk){:target="_blank"}.
