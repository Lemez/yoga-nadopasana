Language acquisition has three cognitive stages: remembering, using and adapting. The stages are cumulative - there is no point in trying a later stage without the one before.




1) Remembering
What is makes something really memorable?

In essence, memory comes down to senses and their emotional effect.

Our senses are designed to be acute, because they can save our lives. Sights, sounds, smells, tastes or physical sensations are the stuff of memory, but their longevity is determined by the emotional response that they elicit. Learning has a clear evolutionary function - to remember signs of danger and safety so as to enable us to live longer. And so it follows quite obviously that the stronger the emotion, the better our brains file it away. 

For example, many of us have visual, or photographic memories. We can look at a sheet of paper, take a mental snapshot, and still be able to recall the image and read the words on it days or even weeks later. This visual recall is a principle that a lot of students use for cramming exams. Most of these images are only retained in short-term memory, and so while this method works for retaining large amounts of immediate information, the images tend to fade over time.  

An emotional visual memory, on the other hand, will stay within us for our entire lives. If we experienced something traumatic like being physically attacked or abused, our brains will have filtered sensual cues from that experience to keep us safe in the future. For example, a subconscious mental snapshot of the look in the offender's eyes, would, years later, trigger a desire to run away if we met someone else with that same look. We sometimes think of this a 'sixth sense', and this intuition is often our brains recalling and interpreting important information from past experiences when it really matters.

Smells, sounds, tastes and physical sensations are the same - whether they signify warmth and safety or fear and danger. The smell of a soup in our favourite grandmother's kitchen, the sound of our first love's voice - these are impressions that stay with us, and trigger instant emotional responses, for life.

Of all the five senses, arguably the most developed are touch and hearing. This is not true for all living creatures, but it is certainly true for human beings, who spend the first nine months of our lives inside the womb, suspended in warm fluid. The senses of sight, smell and taste that we use to thrive outside the womb are not yet required. Hearing, however, is present, but at this stage it is a function of touch: the amniotic fluid transmits vibrations, through our our skin and bones, to our developing brain. After birth, second only to the warmth from her body, our mother's voice is our primary source of calm. Although our hearing now also processes vibrations in the air, skin and bone conduction hearing remains active and important throughout our lives. From hearing a lullaby cradled on your mother's chest, to a cathedral hymn played on a deep, resonant church organ, to a nightclub tune at a rave on huge subwoofers: experiencing sound physically, through the body, has strong associations with feelings of love, security and happiness.



We know - from the millions of us who remember lyrics to songs that we haven't heard in decades - that music and words are a highly memorable combination. There is something about taking a text and applying melody and rhythm to it that lodges it deep in our mind. And so the first stage of language learning must be, by definition, making something memorable. There is no point whatsoever in learning anything in another language that we will not remember later. 


2) Using 




3) Adapting

When you start learning a new language, most of us arrive at a stage at some point where we feel that it doesn't agree with us, it is too hard, or that we are not good enough. If we are really, really lucky, we will fall in love with it.
