Keone came to stay with us on two occasions to assist our son with his A-level revision. He was a breath of fresh air in terms of his ability to both relate and communicate with my son who was somewhat reluctant to revise during the holidays. Keone was a great pleasure to have around and most enjoyable company. He engaged with our son and really engaged his interest and imagination in the two subjects they were working on which were History and History of Art. Our son is Dyspraxic and finds organisation very challenging and Keone seemed to understand his weaknesses and supported him in all aspects of his revision. I would have no hesitation in recommending him as an outstanding tutor. Mrs B, Yorkshire
