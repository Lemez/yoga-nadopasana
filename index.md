### What is Nadopasana? {#what-is-nadopasana}
<br>
Nadopasana is a conscious voice practice from South India.

Literally translating as *devotion to/attention to/worship through* (upasana)  *sound* (nada), the basic exercises form a core daily practice in Carnatic music. Carnatic music is the sacred classical music of South India, which for many centuries was performed exclusively in temples as part of devotional ritual.

In Western terms, Nadopasana can be seen as a practice for <b>embodied music</b>: a conscious placing and moving of the voice inside the body. As such, it can extremely useful for musicians, actors and dancers who use their bodies to create. It can also be extremely effective for anyone who is looking to calm an overactive mind, and create a deep feeling of relaxation through every part of the body.

### How Will I Feel?
<br>
It is relatively common to feel emotional during this practice, either [euphoric or moved to tears](/testimonials/#student-reactions) . We are literally vibrating our bodies with the power of our own voice, massaging ourselves, looking after our own wellbeing. It is an intense act of self-care using sound.

### Why Can It Be So Emotional?
<br>
Hearing is the first sense to develop in the womb, and sound is the primary stimulus for foetal brain development. After birth, it is primarily our mother's voice that calms and relieves us and as we grow, our own voice becomes a key part of our sense of self. In teenage and young adult years, however, the power of this essential part of our identity is often supressed: many of us become conditioned to be quiet, 'nice' and 'not make too much of a noise'. 

The importance to health and wellbeing of healthy breathing, and by extension, an unrestricted voice, has been observed in many studies, and shallow breathing and vocal constriction is prevalent amongst patients with terminal illnesses. Breath, and its vibratory counterpart, voice, are core natural tools that we all have to strengthen, heal and look after ourselves.

Yoga Nadopasana is a practice that strengthens lung power, extends the breath, and vibrates the entire body. 

### Why Did You Make This Site?
<br>
After a lifetime in music, Yoga Nadopasana remains the only way that I know to give me a feeling of euphoria and wellbeing, every day, guaranteed, in just fifteen to twenty minutes of practice. Students also report that this feeling of deep wellbeing comes to them more reliably in this practice than in other forms of yoga. I have been teaching Yoga Nadopasana since 2017, and students always ask if they can continue with me online, and if I can help them to set up a practice routine of their own at home. I was lucky enough to be taught this practice by [the most generous teachers](/about-jonathan/), and I hope that this site will help you to develop your own.
