Hello, I’m Jonathan. When it comes to describing my work, I prefer verbs and adjectives to nouns. I’m certainly not a therapist or a psychologist, and both tutor and mentor are closer to the mark, but leave out a lot of important information. I work mostly with young adults and children with ADD/ADHD, specific learning difficulties (SpLDs) such as, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and I also have experience working with PTSD, autism and cerebral palsy. 

Common situations in which families reach out for help include:
Your child is creative and bright, but they have important exams or studies coming up, and you are worried that they cannot cope alone
Their basic difficulties with timetabling / keeping appointments / losing personal items is causing stress in the family
Communication can be difficult, and nagging them to meet their responsibilties risks souring your relationship
Your child can be both kind and charming, and selfish and disrespectful, and you are at a loss about how to navigate these two extremes
Their issues can lead to high anxiety and low self-esteem
You are afraid that they could develop (or have developed) a drink/drugs problem
Your child is not good at managing money
You are torn between wanting to forgive them and feeling that ‘tough love’ would serve them better in the long run
Sometimes you feel desperate and do not know where to turn or how to help


An SpLD is something that is best tackled by the family as a whole. This means that every child, no matter how old they are, needs their parents to work together with an external support like me to bring about effective change. The main principles I usually work with are:
Goal-oriented: we identify a clear, tangible goal when we start working together and agree to stick with it, on the understanding that achieving this will help us solve the other problems later on
Family-based: these issues can only be overcome with the involvement of the whole family. I make a clear set of records of each session, and communicate regularly with the family 
Positive Nudging - helping them to be the person they want to be
Distraction-zapping - being honest about what gets in the way, and helping to remove those distractions

Accountability - easier to work when someone is with you, expecting you to deliver, you dont want to disappoint someone; even when you know there is revision to do, to sit with someone; to walk alongside you; not to give you advice and tell you what to do; when you are alone you can fall back into bad habits in a second, to walk alongside you for the process;  

A word of warning here: there is no quick fix: it is a long process, and and 




If any of the above seem familiar, I would like to help.
