title: "Sudha Raghunathan - Ghananaya Desika"
description: "Exquisite performance by the greatest Carnatic vocalist of her day. The piece is unique because the lyrics and melody by Sri Koteeswara Iyer are an ode to the majesty of the seven notes, the saptaswara, themselves. Recorded at the Bhavan Centre in London, the best and <a href='https://bhavan.net' target='_blank'>most accessible Indian cultural centre</a> in the world."
