J Task 17
The Siege in the Room

You cannot sit, you cannot write, you cannot work, you can only do nothing, and that nothingness is only heavy, nothing else. How can nothing be so heavy? Only if it has weight. And therefore it cannot be nothing, it must be something, this nothingness. It is crushing. What does it crush? The desire, the spark, the idea to create. It crushes life. It must be heavy indeed to crush life, this nothingness. Is it then death? Too pathetic. It is just absence, depression, anguish, the watching time passing, the nothing to do but to do nothing, the willful, childish wasting of time, of life itself as the most pathetic form of resistance, of self control known to man. I will waste my life, you tell yourself gleefully, that'll show you! Who you is, is mutable, changing, unclear. More like me than you. But still, me, I'll show me by wasting my life to teach me a lesson. It is my nose and I will cut it off, not out of spite, but out of joy. To cut off the nose is to live. Who says we need one to breathe? I will be the first noseless adventurer. To journey forth without a nose. So what? Who says you need one to live? I say you can only live without one. Who knows how sweet the air might be without one? I like my air unfiltered. My thoughts pure. Let me cut it off, so that, at last, I might live.
