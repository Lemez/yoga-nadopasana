Fundamentals: the ADHD Choice

You're right that ADHD is good.

Joe: As soon as i talk to someone, thoughts pop into my head
but i cant do it alone. 

when you are talking w someone the gears start moving quickly

--- intelligence is social, it is not something we possess alone, but in collabroation with and contrast to others

A lot of ppl have initiation anxiety (its an official thing)
A therapist 

J is v good at starting things and getting satisfaction of talking about it
when someone says lets go for it, then he does

once i realised i get this seedy gratificaiton, i did it unconscously for so long
Dad says he does that too

dry-running ideas... in my second gap year i said ill go to italy and do pasta making course, you re so cool tehy all said, i was basking in adoration and didnt do any of it






--- therefore two options for ADHD ppl
to say oh there is sth wrong w me and try to be like them, and suffer all your life
or say, this is me, and make a life in which htese collaborative happenings are common and a core part of your life design
