### The Melakarta system
The Carnatic music system is organised into what is respected by many as the most complete classification system in the world: 72 modes, each belonging to one of 12 parent families (chakras).

### Parent ragas (sampurna)
Each of these 72 modes differs in its swaras, or notes, and is a raga in its own right. They are known as 'full' or <em>sampurna ragas</em>, and have the following characteristics:

- Each raga has all seven *swaras* (notes)
- The arohana (the order going up) is S R G M P D N S
- The avarohana (the order going down) is S N D P M G R S

### Child ragas (janya)
We can think of each of these 72 ragas as being the parent raga, and originating from them are many hundreds of child, or <em>[janya ragas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Janya_ragas){:target=>'_blank'}</em>.

Janya ragas have the following characteristics:
- Each raga can use anywhere between three and all seven notes.
- The arohana (the order of the notes going up) can skip over notes, or turn back and repeat them.
- The avarohana (the order of notes going down) can skip over notes, or turn back and repeat them. 

One of the janya ragas of Shankarabharanam is the pentatonic Hamsadhwani, a wonderful raga for meditation and calming. It is also an easy raga for beginners, as the arohana and avarohana are straight up and straight down, and there are only five notes. You can listen to its signature shapes at the [Raga Surabhi](https://www.ragasurabhi.com/carnatic-music-mp3/raga-hamsadwani-signature.mp3) site.

There are many hundreds of books and articles written about the raga system. I heartily recommend looking at
