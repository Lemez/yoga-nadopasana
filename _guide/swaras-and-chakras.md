The names of the swaras (notes) in Carnatic music and their associated chakras are:  

 swara   | solfege |  note  |   chakra        | position 
 ------- | ------- | ------ | --------------- | --------- 
 SA      |  Do     | C      | *Muladhara*     | under the spine, perineum
 RI      |  Re     | C# / D / D# | *Svadhishthana* | base of the spine, to the rear
 GA      |  Mi     | D# / E | *Nabhi*         | stomach
 MA      |  Fa     | F / F# | *Anahat*        | chest / heart
 PA      |  Sol    | G      | *Vishuddhi*     | throat 
 DA      |  La     | G# / A / A# | *Agnya*         | third eye
 NI      |  Ti     | Bbb / Bb / B | *Bindu*         | dip in back of head
 SA      |  Do     | C      | *Sahasrara*     | crown

In total, the octave is divided into 12 notes, [as in Western music](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mrubinst/tuning/12.html){:target="_blank"}. It is important to know that these pitches are not fixed. Two ragas might contain the same note, but in practice, these notes will be pitched or oscillated differently according to the raga. This is why it is impossible to learn pieces by reading sheet music - it is an oral tradition, and sheet music can be [very confusing]({{site.base_url}}/guide/learning-journey) for beginners.

Only two notes have a fixed pitch, the root SA and the fifth PA.
