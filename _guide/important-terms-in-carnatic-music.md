The three key elements of Carnatic music are:

1. <b>raga</b>: a mode, but it's [more complicated]({{ site.baseurl }}/guide/what-is-a-raga) than that 
2.  <b>talam</b>: the rhythmic cycle, generally marked with your right hand as you sing
3.  <b>bhava</b>: spiritual essence, or divine intention

Further important terms:
-  <b>shruti</b>: [your pitch]({{ site.baseurl }}/guide/finding-your-shruti). This will vary between singers and even according to the time of day
-  <b>swara</b>: a note. The [seven swaras]({{ site.baseurl }}/guide/swaras-and-chakras) are Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Da Ni  
-  <b>sahityam</b>: lyrics, mostly written in one of the South Indian langauges (Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada) or Sanskrit
-  <b>arohana</b>: ascending note order of a raga 
-  <b>avarohana</b>: descending note order of a raga 
-  <b>gamakam</b>: ornamentation or embellishment of a swara
-  <b>geetham</b>: a song
-  <b>varnam</b>: equivalent to a study or Ã©tude in Western music, a composition with that encapsulates the essence of a raga
-  <b>vaggyekara</b>: composer

- [Swathi Thirunal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swathi_Thirunal_Rama_Varma), 19th century, whose compositions are said to embody all three of the essential elements. His descendant [Prince Rama Varma](/resources/#watching) is one of the best living Carnatic teachers.
